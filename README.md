# coding-games-action-game
This is when I was learning how to properly use Pygames and I created a platform game, the game is a 2D game and has a main character, enemies, and he can walk and jump. I equipped him with a power(fireball) so he can shoot at his enemies.
I recieved a lot of the media(character designs, songs, background) from TechWithTim
